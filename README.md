# Weather-App and Zip-validation

The following is a final project from my software engineering 1 course. The goal of the final project was to implement a microservice that served a purpose for the project we were building.
The project is a weather app that returns the temperature, winds, and type of weather in the given zipcode. When a zipcode is submitted, it is sent to a zipcode API that validates if it is a 
correct USA zipcode. If valid, it returns the zipcode and a boolean value of true. 

# To use

To run locally, download the node package. Locate the app.js file in the main folder and in one terminal start 'node app.js'. In another terminal, locate the server.js in the zip-ms folder and type 'node server.js'.
